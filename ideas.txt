just created a cards/ dir in another project to store the basic card ideas for that project.

a convention of .cards or /cards in a project with issue-like info is interesting...  makes sense to track it within the source...

we'd like to keep metadata about, e.g. relationships of major parts of project for diagram purposes, within project repo... 

we're starting to duplicate events for same thing (moving/position_changed) denoting whether
event has originated from raiser - maybe this should be option on every event.

for capturing ideas, i reach for typing into notepad
 - would be great if was that easy in whalley - what would that take?

it seems i have multiple aspects of whalley now or what i'd like to do that are attractive to me: knowledge capture, open card data type, physical metaphor, nice js api, js-rest api duality, not doing too much, collaboration of smaller parts that don't do too much, quality ux
